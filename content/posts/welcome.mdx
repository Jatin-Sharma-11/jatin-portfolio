# Welcome!

I'm excited to share my new portfolio website with you. It's built using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **MDX**.

## Features

- **Dynamic Routing**: Each section has its own page.
- **MDX Blog**: I can write posts in Markdown with React components.
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions using Framer Motion.
- **Comments**: Powered by Giscus.

Stay tuned for more updates!
